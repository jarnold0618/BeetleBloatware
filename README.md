Beetle EV Auxilary Control System.

Description:
The general goal of the Beetle EV Conversion project is to restore an old Wolkswagon Beetle and convert the restored car
to an EV. The purpose of the Auxilary Control System is to interface between a touchscreen (to be specified later) and 
Rasberry Pi (RPi). The Rasberry Pi will act as the main system to control auxilary functions of the car (i.e. headlights,
taillights, windshield wipers, windows, etc.). 

Backend:
Written in C++. Contains classes to interface with controls over subsystems, such as lights.

Frontend:
GUI tbd (maybe Qt)
